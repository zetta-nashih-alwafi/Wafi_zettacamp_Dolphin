              "Maniac", "The Story", "Wish You Were Sober", and "Heather."

            <h4>Album Description:</h4>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"our little angel" is the third EP of Maine-born, LA-based musician, songwriter and vocalist ROLE
              MODEL. The project is the follow-up to last year's ‘oh, how perfect’ EP, which Ones To Watch noted "sets a new precedent for
              bedroom pop," and includes the previously released singles ‘going out’, ‘blind’ and for the people in the back’, the latter of
              which received a stripped back performance from him in July .
            </p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This EP sort of stemmed from the day I wrote and recorded ‘alive’. That song felt like a middle finger
            to everything I have been through, sort of like a rebirth. After recording that song I wanted to keep that feeling throughout,
            and there is this underlying tone of confidence in myself and embracing flaws. I've accepted that this world is fucked, I've
            accepted that my brain doesn't work the way it's supposed to, I've accepted that I'm not perfect. So, in a way, nothing has
            changed, I've just learned to accept the imperfections, and I can only hope it will help others do the same. “ - ROLE MODEL
